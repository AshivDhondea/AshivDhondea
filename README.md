### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Hans, an engineer who lives in Burnaby, British Columbia. With a background in Electrical Engineering and a specialization in radar, I am now transitioning into Deep Learning as a graduate student at Simon Fraser University. My favorite language is Python. I am proficient in LaTeX and TikZ.

## My work ðŸ”­
In recent times, I have been interested in Collaborative Intelligence, an Artificial Intelligence deployment strategy that leverages compute resources on the edge and in the cloud to make deep neural network computations faster and more efficient. Starting from [Deep Feature Transmision Simulator](https://github.com/SFU-Multimedia-Lab/DFTS) developed by [SFU's Multimedia Lab](http://multimedia.fas.sfu.ca/), I adapted the simulator for compatibility with TensorFlow version 2 and extended it with several new capabilities in this [repo](https://github.com/AshivDhondea/DFTS2). In addition to this, I developed a new tensor completion method for collaborative intelligence, which led to a conference publication at ICIP 2021 in Anchorage, AK. DFTS2 with error concealment methods that I implemented led to a second publication at VCIP 2021 in Munich, Germany.

## Ask me about ðŸ’¬

## Fun fact âœ¨
I was born in paradise! My country of birth, Mauritius, is known as paradise island.
