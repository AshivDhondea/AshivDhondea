### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Hans, an engineer who lives in Burnaby, British Columbia. With a background in Electrical Engineering and a specialization in radar, I am now transitioning into Deep Learning as a graduate student at Simon Fraser University. My favorite language is Python. I am proficient in LaTeX and TikZ.

## My work ðŸ”­
Iâ€™m currently working on extending the [Deep Feature Transmision Simulator](https://github.com/SFU-Multimedia-Lab/DFTS) developed by [SFU's Multimedia Lab](http://multimedia.fas.sfu.ca/). I have modified the Deep Feature Transmission Simulator to run in Tensorflow version 2 in this [repo](https://github.com/AshivDhondea/DFTS_TF2)!

## Ask me about ðŸ’¬ 
* Target tracking, state estimation & radar target tracking.
* Radar signal and data processing & radar system simulation.
* Orbit determination & astrodynamics simulations.
* Image classification with ConvNets.

## How to reach me ðŸ“«
By email.

## Fun fact âœ¨
I was born in paradise! My country of birth, Mauritius, is known as paradise island.
